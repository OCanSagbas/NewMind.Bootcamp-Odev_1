# Data Analysis and Manipulation

## 📋 About the Project

This project is part of the **Patika.dev & New Mind AI Bootcamp** and focuses on **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**. It involves working with **sales** and **customer data** to perform various data manipulation and analysis techniques to gain actionable insights.

---

## 🛠️ Project Goals
- Enhance advanced data manipulation and analysis skills.
- Derive meaningful insights from data.
- Present results using effective visualization techniques.

---

## 🔍 Key Features
This project covers:
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing and outlier values.
   - Merging sales and customer datasets via `musteri_id`.
   
2. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Analyzing weekly and monthly sales and product trends.
   - Identifying the first and last sales day of each month.
   - Visualizing fluctuations in time series data.

3. **Categorical and Numerical Analysis**
   - Calculating total sales and percentages by product category.
   - Analyzing sales trends based on age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 50+).
   - Comparing spending habits of male and female customers.

4. **Advanced Data Manipulation**
   - Calculating total spending by city and ranking cities by top-spending customers.
   - Computing growth rates for products and categories.
   - Monthly total sales by category and visualizing their change rates.

5. **Bonus: Pareto Analysis**
   - Identifying products contributing to 80% of total sales.
